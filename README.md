# Micorservice
In this project we will be creating a node.js microservice and deploy it using a Docker Swarm Cluster.

Overview:

Microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

|PROS | CONS |
| :---: | :---: |
| Application starts faster | The complexity of creating a distributed system |
| Easier to deploy new versions | Complexity of deploying/managing different types of services |
| Scale the development easily | Cross-cutting concerns don't show up at design time |
| No commitment for technology |
